## Projects

This repository showcases data science, economic analysis, and visualization projects, each with a detailed README including methodologies, data sources, and key findings.

### [1. LinkedIn Job Scraper for Panama City](webScraping/)

Automates job postings extraction for Data Scientists in Panama City using web scraping, retrieving job title, company, location, and job URL. Handles missing data and network issues efficiently.

**Technologies Used:** Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests, Regular Expressions.

### [2. Analyzing Data Science Job Market in Latin America](laborMarketEDA/)

Examines the labor market for data scientists in Latin America, analyzing salary distributions, job requirements, and factors influencing earnings. Uses EDA and multivariate regression modeling to identify trends. 

**Technologies Used:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn.

### [3. Salary Prediction: k-NN vs. Linear Regression](salaryPredictionModels/)

Compares k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) regression vs. Linear Regression for predicting data science salaries. The Elbow Method determined k = 3 as the optimal value. Evaluation metrics include R² and RMSE. 

**Technologies used:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

### [4. Visualizing Key Economic Indicators](streamlitEconomicIndicators/)

Developed an interactive dashboard for analyzing economic indicators across countries using World Bank data. Users can select variables and generate customized visualizations.

**Technologies Used:** Python, Streamlit, Pandas, wbdata, Matplotlib, Seaborn

### [5. Image Processing and OCR Project](imageProcessing/)

Uses Tesseract OCR and OpenCV to extract text from images and detect faces when a specific keyword is found in the extracted text.

**Technologies used:** Python, Tesseract OCR, OpenCV, Pillow, numpy.

### [6. Survival Analysis of Recidivism Risk](survivalAnalysis/)

Applies survival analysis to examine how individual characteristics influence the timing of recidivism after release. Combines Kaplan-Meier estimates, log-rank tests, complementary log-log plots, and Cox regression models to identify key risk and protective factors.

**Technologies used:** R, survival, survminer, ggplot2, dplyr
